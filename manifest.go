// Package tuivpn exists for one reason: to embed the repository's tool.json
// into the binary.
//
// The manifest is the family's single source of truth about a tool. Since it
// also carries the `backends[]` block — which version of each backend is the
// minimum, which ones have been tested, what changes on the old ones — the
// running binary reads it too, and no version number has to be written into
// the code. go:embed cannot reach outside its own package directory, so the
// embedding package is the module root.
