# Backend smoke test for tui-wireguard, run inside a lab guest.
#
# The contract (see tui-tools/tui-lab): this script runs on the guest as the
# unprivileged lab user, escalates with `sudo -n` only, prints a short PASS/FAIL
# table and exits non-zero if anything failed. The binary under test is at
# $TUI_LAB_BIN (default: tui-wireguard on PATH).
#
# What a smoke test proves is that the tool reads the machine's *real* subject
# and agrees with the machine's own tooling — not that a fake renders. The
# template has no real subject worth asserting on, so what is here is the part
# every tool shares: the --report block. Add yours next to it, and add a
# record_compat that appends the probed version to compat/results.jsonl.

# actually driving, that it still answers under --demo, and that it keeps its
# privacy promise — the block goes into a public issue, so a home path or the
# host name appearing in it is a bug, not a cosmetic detail.
