// Package wireguard is the part of tui-wireguard that is about its own
// subject: WireGuard interfaces, their peers, and the host around them (the
// routing table a forwarding server proposes its networks from, and the
// firewall that decides whether a handshake reaches the listen port).
// Everything generic (palette, widgets, configuration, running commands) comes
// from tui-kit and is not repeated here.
//
// This package is also the tool's single exec site: the only place a process
// is started (through the kit runner) is internal/wireguard, so the command
// the confirm dialog showed is provably the command that ran. It drives a
// handful of programs — `wg`, `wg-quick`, read-only `ip`, `sh`/`install` for
// the bootstrap flow, and `iptables` for the host firewall — but every one of
// them goes through the same runner boundary.
//
// PRIVACY: a private key never leaves this package on an argv or in any
// rendered value. A new interface's key pair is generated inside one root
// shell that writes the private key straight into a root-only file and prints
// only the public key; the interface conf references that file through PostUp
// instead of inlining the key. Adding a peer needs only its public key; a
// pre-shared key is generated the same way and passed to `wg set` as a file
// path, never as a value on the command line (a command line is visible in
// `ps` to every user on the machine). The model records whether an interface
// has a private key, never the key itself.
